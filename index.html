        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We're a group of crochet enthusiasts based in Sacramento. We're a passionate bunch of yarn lovers who've come together to share, learn, and spread the joy of crochet. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just picked up your first hook, there's a place for you here. Whether you're a newbie or a pro, join us for monthly meet-ups, workshops, and crochet-alongs! Monthly Meet-ups: Held at local cafes and parks, our meet-ups are the heart and soul of our group. It's where we stitch, chat, and sip on our favorite brews.
Workshops: For those keen to level up their skills, we host occasional workshops taught by members or invited experts. From intricate patterns to mastering basics, we cover it all.
Charity Drives: We believe in giving back. Every year, we host charity drives where we craft blankets, hats, and scarves for those in need in our community. </p>
